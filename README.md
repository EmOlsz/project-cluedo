# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

This weekâ€™s project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo or Clue. 
The purpose was to practice creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.


## The problem

I followed the instructions to make the blue level work, and moved on to red and black levels creating one feature at the time. 
I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main focus has been working with arrays, objects, and the random-function.
I put in styling at the end when I had all the logic in place.
